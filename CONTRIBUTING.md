## How to Contribute

Follow this guide to ensure a smooth contribution process. If you're planning significant work or substantial changes, please create an issue labeled "contribution enquiry" to discuss your proposal. This will help ensure that your work aligns with the project's goals.

### Steps to Get Started

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Start by [forking the repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/).

2. **Clone Your Fork**  
   Clone your forked repo to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:tduyng/prettyoutput.git
   ```

3. **Set Upstream**  
   Link back to the main project repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git://github.com/tduyng/prettyoutput.git
   ```

4. **Sync With Upstream**  
   Fetch the latest changes from upstream, usually the main development branch:
   ```bash
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

5. **Create a Topic Branch**  
   Create a new branch for your feature, fix, or enhancement:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

6. **Write Tests**  
   Ensure your changes are reliable by including tests. For small patches, a simple test is fine; for new features, create a dedicated test suite.

7. **Coding Style and Conventions**  
   Maintain the project’s coding standards. Consistent indentation, comments, and style improve readability.

8. **Commit Changes in Logical Chunks**  
   Split your commits into logical parts. Use git’s [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase) to keep your commit history clean.

9. **Merge With Upstream**  
   Sync your branch with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

10. **Push to Your Fork**  
    Push your topic branch to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin <topic-branch-name>
    ```

11. **Create a Pull Request**  
    Open a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description, explaining why and how you made your changes.

### Guidelines for a Successful Contribution

- **Focused Scope**: Keep your PR focused; avoid unrelated changes.
- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful commit messages. See [this guide](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) for best practices.
- **Style Consistency**: Follow the project’s formatting and coding style.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation or comments as needed to explain your changes.
